# JezzBall for GameBuino

[GameBuino](http://gamebuino.com) implementation of the [Jezzball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JezzBall) game. This is a tribute to the [TI-89 implementation](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/121/12158.html) I used to play for hours.

# Playing the game

You need a GameBuino or an emulator.

Refer to the [GameBuino](http://gamebuino.com/wiki/index.php?title=Getting_started#Get_a_Gamebuino) homepage, or if you like making things I advise you the [MakeBuino kit](http://www.makerbuino.com/). There is a [Kickstater campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/albertgajsak/makerbuino-a-diy-game-console) running until April 18 2017.

The GameBuino homepage presents a [collection of emulators](http://gamebuino.com/wiki/index.php?title=Emulators). I used [gbsim](http://gamebuino.com/wiki/index.php?title=Emulators#gbsim) for my development.

# Compiling the game

You need the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software), and the GameBuino library. Please refer to the [official wiki](http://gamebuino.com/wiki/index.php?title=Getting_started#Software_setup).

# Issues

For the moment I only tested the game with an emulator. I will be able to test it on hardware when I will receive my MakeBuino from the Kickstarter campaign (hopefully in May 2017). Please feel free to tell me if you have any trouble playing the game, either with an emulator or a physical console.
