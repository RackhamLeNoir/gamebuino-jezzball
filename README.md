# JezzBall for GameBuino

[GameBuino](http://gamebuino.com) implementation of the [Jezzball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JezzBall) game. This is a tribute to the [TI-89 implementation](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/121/12158.html) I used to play for hours.

# Playing the game

You need a GameBuino or an emulator.

Refer to the [GameBuino](http://gamebuino.com/wiki/index.php?title=Getting_started#Get_a_Gamebuino) homepage, or if you like making things, I advise you the [MakerBuino kit](http://www.makerbuino.com/).

The GameBuino homepage presents a [collection of emulators](http://gamebuino.com/wiki/index.php?title=Emulators). I used [gbsim](http://gamebuino.com/wiki/index.php?title=Emulators#gbsim) for my development.

# Compiling the game

You need the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software), and the GameBuino library. Please refer to the [official wiki](http://gamebuino.com/wiki/index.php?title=Getting_started#Software_setup).

# Issues

Please feel free to tell me if you have any trouble playing the game, either with an emulator or a physical console.
